# SCM
A sample .Net Core application in Supply Chain management domain with  TDD approach
1. In this application, I have tried to resolve problem statement of generating packing slip as per different criteria.
2. .Net Core 3.1 is used (Visual Studio 2019)
3. Decision of what action to take is based on product category. A product can be under multiple categories hence we can apply various combinations of criteria and extend the application as needed. 
4. Repository pattern is used. I have tried to write clean code by separating layers into projects.
5. HTML Template is used for packing slip.
6. Bootstrap is used for a little UI enhancement.
7. Email sending to owner, in case of membership activation is pending and will add it if possible.
